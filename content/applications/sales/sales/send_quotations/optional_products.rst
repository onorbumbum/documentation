Optional products
=================

The use of optional products is a marketing strategy that involves the cross-selling of products
along with a core product. The aim is to offer useful and related products to customers, which may result
in an increased sale.

For instance, if a customer wants to buy a car, they have the choice to order massaging seats, as
well, or ignore the offer and simply buy the car. Presenting the choice to purchase optional
products enhances the customer experience.

Optional products on quotations
===============================

With the Odoo *Sales* application, it is possible to add or modify optional products directly on
quotations (located under the :guilabel:`Optional Products` tab on a quotation form, in the *Sales*
application).

   Clicking the :guilabel:`Customer Preview` button, reveals a preview of the quotation customers
   receive via email, along with the optional products they have a chance of adding to their order.

In practice, your customers are able to add different optional products to an order by clicking the
:guilabel:`Shopping Cart icon`, located to the right of the optional product line.

Additionally, if a customer selects all the optional products suggested, these additional items are
automatically filled in the quotation managed by the salesman.

When the customer adds an optional product(s) to an order, the salesperson sees each movement made
by the customer, providing them with accurate tracking of the entire order in the backend of the
*Sales* application (on the specific quotation form).

Optional products on quotation templates
========================================

Be sure to review the documentation about :doc:`quote_template` to better understand how quotation
templates can be enabled, created, designed, and managed before reading the following.

For quotation templates, just like a typical quotation form, there is also an
:guilabel:`Optional Products` tab, wherein related products or services can be added to a quotation
template. Those products added under the :guilabel:`Optional Products` tab are present in the
quotation, by default, whenever that particular quotation template is used.
