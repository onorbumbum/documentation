Main accounting concepts
========================

Double-entry bookkeeping
========================

Odoo automatically creates all the underlying journal entries for each of your accounting
transactions such as customer invoices, vendor bills, point-of-sales orders, expenses, inventory
valuations, etc.
For each accounting transaction there is the double-entry bookkeeping system, whereby the total
amount debited always equals the total amount credited.

Accrual and cash basis methods
==============================

Both accrual and cash basis reporting are supported in Odoo. This allows to report income and
expense when the transaction occurs (i.e., accrual basis), or when payment is made or received
(i.e., cash basis).

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`Cash basis <../taxation/taxes/cash_basis_taxes>`

Multi-company
=============

Several companies can be managed within the same database. Each company has its
:doc:`Chart of Accounts <initial_configuration/chart_of_accounts>` and gets consolidation reports
following its rules. Users can access several companies but can only work in one company at a time.

Multi-currency environment
==========================

A :doc:`multi-currency <../others/multi_currency>` environment with an automated
exchange rate to ease international transactions is available in Odoo. Every transaction is recorded
in the company's default currency; for transactions occurring in another currency, Odoo stores both
the value in the company's currency and the transactions' currency value. Odoo generates currency
gains and losses after reconciling the journal items.

International Standards
=======================

Odoo Accounting supports more than 70 countries. It provides the central standards and mechanisms
common to all nations, and thanks to country-specific modules, local requirements are fulfilled.
Fiscal positions exist to address regional specificities like the chart of accounts, taxes, and any
requirement.

   - :doc:`Fiscal localization packages <../../fiscal_localizations>`

Accounts receivable and payable
===============================

By default, a single account for the account receivable entries and one for the account payable
entries. Transactions are related to your **contacts**, which allow you to perform analysis per
customer, vendor or supplier.

The **Partner Ledger** report displays the balance of your customers and suppliers. It is available
by going to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Reporting --> Partner Ledger`.

Reporting
=========

The following financial :doc:`reports <../reporting/overview/main_reports>` are available and
updated in real-time:

- :guilabel:`Statement reports`: Balance sheet, Profit and Loss, Cash flow Statement, Tax Report, ES
  Sales List.
- :guilabel:`Audit Reports`: General Ledger, Trial Balance, Journal Report, Intrastat Report, Check
  Register.
- :guilabel:`Partner Reports`: Partner Ledger, Aged Receivable, Aged Payable.
- :guilabel:`Management`: Invoice Analysis, Unrealized Currency Gains/Losses, Depreciation Schedule,
  Disallowed Expenses, Budget Analysis, Product Margins, 1099 Report.
- **Country specific reports** based on your company's location and the fiscal localization packages
  installed on your database.

.. tip::
   Odoo's report engine allows you to customize your own report based on your own
   :doc:`formulas <../reporting/overview/customize>`.

Tax report
----------

Odoo computes all accounting transactions for the specific tax period and uses these totals to
calculate the tax obligation.

.. important::
  Once the tax report has been generated, Odoo does not allow to make journal entries involving VAT
  in the closed period. If the period is locked, any correction to customer or vendor
  bills have to be recorded in the next period.

.. note::
   Depending on the country's localization, an .XML file can be generated to upload the tax report
   directly on the VAT platform of the legal administration.

Bank synchronization
====================

The bank synchronization system directly connects with your bank institution to automatically
import all bank transactions into your database. Offering an overview of your cash flow without
logging into the online banking system or waiting for paper bank statements.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`Bank Synchronization <../bank/bank_synchronization>`

Inventory valuation
===================

Both periodic (manual) and perpetual (automated) inventory valuations are supported in Odoo. The
available methods are standard price, average price, last-in first-out method (LIFO) and first-in
first-out method (FIFO).

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`View impact of the valuation method on your transactions
     </applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory/management/reporting/inventory_valuation_config>`

Easy retained earnings
======================

Retained earnings are the portion of income retained by your business. Odoo automatically calculates
your current year earnings in real-time, so no year-end journal or rollover is required. The profit
and loss balance is automatically reported to your balance sheet report.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`Accounting Cheat Sheet <cheat_sheet>`

Fiduciaries
===========

The :guilabel:`Accounting Firms` mode can be activated by going to :menuselection:`Accounting -->
Configuration --> Settings --> Accounting Firms mode`. When enabled:

- The document's sequence becomes editable on all documents;
- A new field :guilabel:`Total (tax incl.)` appears in order to speed up and control the encoding by
  automating line creation with the right account and tax;
- :guilabel:`Invoice Date` and :guilabel:`Bill Date` are automatically pre-filled when encoding a
  transaction.
- A :guilabel:`Quick encoding` option for Customer Invoices and Vendor bills.
